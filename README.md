This Wolfram Mathematica program was used partially in the thesis "Quantization of Unstable Modes in Non-Globally Hyperbolic Spacetimes" and fully in the paper: https://doi.org/10.1103/qy6r-b55b
All the figures of the paper are present in this Mathematica code. Starting with the Penrose diagrams (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 in the paper) and with the Probability plots (Fig. 3 - Fig. 6 in the paper).
